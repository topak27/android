MathGame â€” is a very simple app, created withing one day for some Kiev company.
There are 9 random questions and the timer, starting after your first click.
After that you'll get your score and time elapsed.
My own best try is 19 seconds (and 100% score)! ;)
To install it just download the MathGame.apk from /bin.
